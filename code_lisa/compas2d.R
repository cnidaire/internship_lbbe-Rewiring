# Script Description: code to generate species abundances on an environmental gradient
# (can also be interpreted as consumer-resource species interactions)
# adapted from Stéphane Dray (1/12/2004 Montreal from an idea of J Oksanen)


#' Simulate a community matrix
#'
#' Simulate abundance values based on species traits. The ecological interpretation can be
#' a sites x species matrix or a resource x consumer species interaction matrix.
#'
#' @param nsp Number of species / consumer
#' @param nsite Number of sites / resource species
#' @param le.grad gradient length for traits/environmental variables. The values are
#' comprised between 0 and `le.grad`.
#' @param buffer buffer to allow species / consumer species optima to fall outside the gradient by
#' 0 - `buffer` ; `le.grad` + `buffer`.
#' @param col_abund Optional vector of abundances for species/consumers.
#' If missing, abundances are taken from a uniform law between `min.ab` and `max.ab`.
#' @param row_abund Optional vector of abundances in sites/ for resource species.
#' If missing, abundances are taken from a uniform law between `min.ab` and `max.ab`.
#' @param min.ab minimal abundance value for the uniform law (if `col_abund` and/or `row_abund` are absent)
#' @param max.ab maximal abundance value for the uniform law (if `col_abund` and/or `row_abund` are absent)
#' @param mean.tol Mean value for the species/consumers niche tolerance (standard deviation).
#' The species/consumers niche tolerance are drawn from a normal law of mean `mean.tol`
#' and standard deviation `sd.tol` for each trait axis.
#' @param sd.tol Standard deviation for the species/consumers niche tolerance (standard deviation)
#' The species/consumers niche tolerance are drawn from a normal law of mean `mean.tol`
#' and standard deviation `sd.tol` for each trait axis.
#' @param ratio.grad length of the second gradient as a ratio of the first one.
#' @param col_prefix Prefix for the column names of the matrix. Defaults to "s" for "species".
#' @param row_prefix Prefix for the row names of the matrix. Defaults to "e" for "environment".
#' @param rowvar_prefix Prefix for the column names of the row variable. Defaults to "env" for "environment".
#' @param remove_zeroes If there are unobserved species, should we keep them in the final matrix?
#' @param ninter Total number of observations in the web
#' @param return_intermediate Return intermediate results? If yes, will return the
#' probability of interaction based on matching only, on abundances only and the predicted
#' mix of matching and abundances (before sampling).
#' @param delta Exponent between 0 and 1 to give more (1) or less (0) weight to trait matching relatively to
#' abundance.
#'
#' @return An object of class compas, which is a list with 3 components (4 if `return_intermediate`):
#'
#' + comm: the community matrix of dimension `nsite` x `nsp`. Row names are `row_prefix`
#' followed by 1..`nsite` and column names are `col_prefix` followed by 1..`nsp`.
#' + rowvar: the values of the row variables (resource traits/environment gradient values). It is a
#' nsite x 2 matrix. Row names are `row_prefix` followed by 1..`nsite` and column names are
#' `rowvar_prefix` followed by 1 and 2.
#' + colvar: the values of the column variables (consumer/species traits values). It is a `nsp` x 2 x 2 array.
#' Row names are `row_prefix` followed by 1..`nsp`. Column names in each array dimension are mean and sd (for
#' the mean and standard deviation of the species niche, respectively). Each array 3rd dimension corresponds
#' to a resource trait or environmental gradient value.
#' + if `return_intermediate`, a fourth component named intermediate is returned. The first element
#' is named `p_matching` and contains the matrix of probabilities of interactions based only on matching.
#' The second `ab_neutral` contains the matrix of count of interactions as predicted by species abundances. The third
#' `p_mix`  contains the matrix of probabilities of interactions taking into account the mix of matching and abundances.
