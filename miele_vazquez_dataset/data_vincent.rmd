The R dataset consists of the bipartite plant-pollinator interaction matrices (*bipartite.networks*) for 18 subseas (3 subseasons per 6 years), 18 subseasonal dependence matrices (*directed.networks*), and the plant species (*plant.id*) and pollinator species (*pollinator.id*) identification codes. The code used for the analyses (miele-JAE.R) is also provided.

18 seasons, 59 plants and 196 pollinators

```{r}
season_1 <- directed.networks[1, , ]
# View(season_1)
which(season_1[2,] != 0)# pas beaucoup differents de 0

# to keep only the connected species
test <- season_1[which(rowSums(season_1) != 0), which(colSums(season_1) != 0)]

plot(graph_from_incidence_matrix(test), vertex.size=5)
```

```{r}
pollinator.id
plant.id
```
