## SVD
The regular denationalization of a rectangular matrix $A$ of size $n \times m$ by $X^{-1} AX$ the resulting eigenvectors in X will not always be orthogonal, it requires to have a matrix $A$ a square matrix to have $Ax = \lambda x$. Also we have no 
The singular value décomposition methods enable to diagonalise a rectangular matrix $A$ of size $n \times m$.

$A = U \Sigma V^\intercal$
$\Leftrightarrow A = \sum_i \sigma_i U_i \otimes V_i^\intercal$
the  $\Sigma$ matrix contains only values on the diagonal and contains the $\sigma$ values that are analogous to the eigenvalues 
We call U the left singular vector and V the right singular vector of $\sigma$

enables to obtain a sum of the vector product of rank one matrices, enabling to approximate more and more accurately the origin matrix.
