# 2 kinds of methods:

## 1) Descriptive

### Principal Component analysis (PCA/ACP)

transform the correlated variables into new variable uncorrelated one with another: principal components. It enable to reduce the number of variable and recap the information (underline the most important ones).

On continuous data

### Correspondence analysis (AFC: analyse factorielle des correspondences)

**Le truce sur lequel je vais bosser**

conceptually similar to ACP but rather applies on categorical data. If more than two categorical variable: multiple correspondence analysis.


### Factor analysis (Analyse factorielle)

a method used to describe an ensemble of variables thanks to latent variables (non-observed ones) In order to reduce the number of variables, the methods compute these variables as a linear combination of observed variables.

### Cluster analysis



### Multidimensional scaling

### Iconography of correlations

## 2) Explicative

### Linear regression

### ANOVA


# AFC / Correspondence analysis

## Structure data

on columns:environment
on rows: individuals

## Independence model

usually, it is assumed that the columns and the rows are independent, hence the joint probability of independent event is the product of the marginal probabilities: P(A & B) = P(A) x P(B)

## Test $\chi^2$

$$\chi^2_{obs} = \sum^I_{i=1}\sum^J_{j=1}\frac{(eff_{obs}-eff_{th})^2}{eff_{th}}$$

## Questions

so CA is based on $\chi^2$ distance unlike the PCA that is based on euclidean distance apparently

# General principle for ACP and others?

matrice de correlation
valeurs et vecteurs propres, puis classer les valeurs propres par ordre d√©croissant et ainsi on obtient les vacteurs propres correspondant qui sont les composantes principales.

# Ecological resemblance

Several reasons may preside to the absence of a species from a site, besides
unimodal distributions and niche optimality. Species are known to occur in suboptimal environments, especially when they are subjected to competition. So, the niche of a species may be present in one (or both) of two sites but be occupied by substitute species. Absence may also be the result of the dispersion pattern of a species, historical events, or, more simply, stochastic sampling variation.
