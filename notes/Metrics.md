Based on [[Lau et al. - 2017 - Ecological network metrics opportunities for synt.pdf|Lau 2017]] but there is actually way more, I just picked the one that seemed the most relevant.

**Whole network:**
- density
- centrality distribution
- centralization
- graph diameter
- modularity
- link density
- co-occurrence
- nestedness
- evenness
- diversity
- richness
- stability

**Groups/ sub-network:**
- motif
- food-chain length
- chain length
- average length path

**Node:**
- centrality
- degree
- eigenvalue centrality
- temperature (apparently measures the nestedness of  bipartite network)
- indicator species
- removal importance
- connectance
- trophic level

based on the [[doc_bipartite.pdf|bipartite r package]]:

**network level:**
- connectance
- web assymetry
- link per species
- number of compartiments
- compartiment diversity
- cluster coefficient
- nestedness
- weighted nestedness
- weighted NODF
- interaction strength asymmetry
- specialization asymmetry
- linkage density
- fisher alpha diversity
- interaction evenness
- shannon diversity
- H2, network wide specialization index

**group level:**
- number of species in respective trophic level
- mean number of links
- mean number of shared partners
- cluster coefficient
- checkerboardness
- v ratio
- discrepency: the number of links one would have to move to achieve perfect nestedness
- degree distribution
- extinction slope
- robustness
- niche overlap
- generality
- partner diversity
- effective partners
- functional diversity

**species level:**
- degree
- normalized degree
- species strength
- nested rank
- interaction for interaction push/pull
- Paired Difference Index
- resource
- species specificity
- Pollination Service Index
- Node Speciallisation index
- betweenness
- closeness
- Fisher's alpha diversity
- effective number of partners
- proportional generality
- proportional generality
- Bluthgen's discrimination/selectivity index

Basically the same as previously but with fewer that a better explained
