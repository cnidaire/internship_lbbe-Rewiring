# Why imprtant to predict interactions in a changing env

 - Image bioderversity colapse
 - 

---

# Factors to predict interactions
- abundances
- trait matching
- phenology
- others: adaptzation cpability (rewiring)

---

# Subject of the internship

---

# Current method to compute rewiring

take the schematics from poisot or frÃ¼nd (and cite)

---

# How do we plan to study rewiring : AFC

Show a dummy network and what a CA looks like 

---

# Foucart CA

---

# Compare to other methods and why it did not work (or did it?)

compare to toju and to tolerance

---

# Why it did not work

- schematics: reconstruction of the trait and not profile interaction (the id of the interactant does not matter)
- schematics: disappearance of species -> new interactions less favourable (not taken into account in simulated data)

# Perspectives to improve beta diversity and further research on Foucart
