# Adaptive rewiring aggravates the effects of species loss in ecosystems

ability of consumers to rewire to novel prey should mitigate the consequences of species loss by reducing the risk of cascading extinction

Here, rewiring due to the initial failure of one node

hence either change of the strength of relation with other species or formation of new links

# Questions:

How can we be sure when we are looking for a way to characterize rewiring from the data that the thing we are observing are indeed some rewiring?

# Rewiring biological explanation:

Many examples in Beyond species, in section "The basic processes"

- one interaction can allow new interactions to happen, for example, the case opportunistic pathogens that have a greater success of infection in host that are already immunocompromised by other infections. (from beyond species: Poisot et al, originally from Olivier 2012).
- The turnover of some species can lead to rewiring and it seems like it is the most commonly considered case. The disappearance of a species can lead the species that where interacting with it to create new connections with other already existing species of the network.
- The opposite is also true, the apparition of a new specie will most likely lead to new connection with the other species of the network and possibly make some other disappear. The most common example is the one of invasive species.

It can be due not to the disappearance a species but just d different phenology or a shifted one, due to the modification of the environment for example.

I am not sure of when is the limit to stop talking about rewiring, because some mechanisms can have an impact on the strength of an interaction without leading to a complete disappearance.

In *"Food web rewiring in a changing world"*, discuss about two kind of rewiring:
- **topological rewiring**: mobile generalist species will redistribute in systems where they were previously absent and foraging on new preys. One of the potential effects can be increasing the connectance and decreasing the modularity (Kortsh et al 2015).
- **interaction strength rewiring**: mobile generalist species that navigate between habitats and ecosystems to forage will shift their relative use of differentially altered habitats and ecosystems.

# Dataset

Apparently, there is the dataset from Shleuning et al, 2011,2012 for spatially-replicated dataset.
And Menke et al 2012 for the temporally-replicated dataset.

Guzzo et al, 2017: data of foraging and lake temperature over 11 years

# Application

Can enable to indicate imminent collapse of one or more species.

Predict impact of climate change on the world's ecosystems.

# Main point of interest when studying interactions:

- diet of the species
- their ability to move

# Important points

- be careful, the rewiring isn't only about who is eating who, there is complex interactions with the soils, plants, microorganisms, parasites, etc. And the nature of these interactions is not restricted to predation, it can be different like competition (or just bothering one another, or maybe even mutual aid (facilitation) however it is not so hard to represent in a topological network, but in a weighted one, it can be harder, because we can not talk in frequencies.

Hence it can be hard to quantify all the relations as the nature can be really different, even inside of the same kind, two animals will not eat as much. So it is getting really complex

- never forget that even plants are able of migration and are able of adaptation
- rewiring are mainly initiated by two causes (a bit entangled/linked):
	+ modification of the environment:
		* warming
		* pollution
		* others
	+ anthropologic causes:
		* they talked about an Indian city that is growing and nature has to adapt. An other example I thought about is about COVID, where a virus from pangolin was brought in contact with humans and created and new interaction.
		* hunting (personal guess)
		* deforestation like in Brasil (personal guess)
- The responses modification of the environment (the most treated subject) are:
	+ migration, either to find new food in other locations or to escape harsh conditions (such as heat, this works for terrestrial and marine environments).
		* it can then lead to rewiring
	+ rewiring:
		* topological
		* interaction strength
