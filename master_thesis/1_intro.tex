\section{Introduction}




\begin{itemize}
    \item relier au climate change avec les notions de shift de niches
    \item define niche de grinnel, elton (hutchinson) realized and fundamental
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \underline{Grinellian niche:} the niche of the species is determined by the habitat in which it lives and its accompanying behavioural modification. It can be defined by abiotic variables and environmental conditions on broad scale.
        \item \underline{Eltonian niche:} "The niche of an animal means its place in the biotic environment, its relations to food and enemies"
        \item classified niches according to foraging activities.
        \item response to and effect on the environment
        \item \underline{Hutchinsonian niche:} is a n-dimensional hyper-volume
    \end{itemize}
    \item rewiring
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The beta diversity such as defined by Poisot in Poisot 2012 or fr√ºnd (check which one did it first) is a metric used to quantify the network  dissimilarity into species turnover and interaction turnover, also called rewiring.
    \end{itemize}
    \item trait matching
        \item what is trait matching
        \item how do we quantify it?
    \item introduce what we are going to do
\end{itemize}
